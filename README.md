# Development Progress

Welcome to the first Android app project I've developed: an ECommerce application. This app is designed to be a platform where users can both buy and sell products. It's an open-source project, so anyone is welcome to contribute! You can add or remove products according to your needs, making it a versatile tool for all users.

### Features
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.
- **Product Management**: Add, remove, and update product listings with ease.
- **Cart Functionality**: Users can add products to their cart and manage their selections before making a purchase.

### How to Contribute
Feel free to fork this repository, make enhancements, and submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated and will help improve the app for everyone.
